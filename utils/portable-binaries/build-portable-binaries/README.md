# Portable binaries packaging

This directory contains helper scripts used by `../build-portable-binaries.sh`.

## Output layout

The main script produces:

```
ligero/
  bins/
    linux-amd64/
      bin/
      lib/
    linux-arm64/
      bin/
      lib/
    macos-arm64/
      bin/
      lib/
  shader/
    *.wgsl
```

And a single tarball `ligero-bins.tar.gz` containing the `ligero/` folder.

## Notes

- Linux builds run in Docker and include an RPATH of `$ORIGIN/../lib` so binaries prefer the bundled `lib/` directory.
- macOS builds run natively (Apple Silicon) and add `@executable_path/../lib` as an rpath so binaries prefer the bundled `lib/` directory.
